## SMS Youtube

In a few days we are going to have a [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/IPAs-APIs/events/228942964/) at [the office](http://messagebird.com) and I thought of doing something silly so that the people attending could play videos and listen to music together (youtube party yeeyyy!!). 

So I made this little hack real quick where people could SMS a video title to a VMN(Virtual Mobile Number) and it would show on a page openned on a computer with a screen on the kitchen (that's where we do parties at MessageBird). 

## Wanna try?
